# How to use:
# - To add or edit responsibilities, update the general_responsibilities section below.
# - To add or change chart reference lines and status logic, update the ReferenceLines section.
#
## ReferenceLines:
#   - reference_line: The Y-value for the horizontal line on the chart (the threshold).
#   - direction: 'above' or 'below'.
#       - direction: above
#           * The metric is EXCELLENT if its value is greater than or equal to the reference line (metric >= reference_line).
#           * The metric is NEEDS ATTENTION if its value is less than the reference line (metric < reference_line).
#           * Example: For glass_repair_completion, direction: above means 10 or more is EXCELLENT, below 10 is NEEDS ATTENTION.
#       - direction: below
#           * The metric is EXCELLENT if its value is less than or equal to the reference line (metric <= reference_line).
#           * The metric is NEEDS ATTENTION if its value is greater than the reference line (metric > reference_line).
#           * Example: For oil_waste, direction: below means 40 or less is EXCELLENT, above 40 is NEEDS ATTENTION.
#
# Example ReferenceLines entry:
#   oil_waste:
#     reference_line: 40
#     direction: below
#   glass_repair_completion:
#     reference_line: 10
#     direction: above
